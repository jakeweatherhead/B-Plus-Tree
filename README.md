This is an assignment from my 2nd year Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of Pretoria.
I completed it in approximately 3 days, and was 1 of 13 students in a class of 329 to get 100% for the project.
If you run the program, you will see that there is still a lot of work to be done. It still has bugs and inefficiencies.
I think it would be cool to build this to a point of high-theoretical accuracy and compete with websites such
as the University of San Francisco's B+ Tree visualiser, or Visualgo's B+ Tree section. The nice thing about this
assignment was that it was easy to test. I implemented a rudimentary blackbox fuzzer which, largely, automated
the testing process. From there, it was just a matter of how many tests I could fit in before the deadline.
