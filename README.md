<h1>B+ Tree Program</h1>

This is Java assignment from the Data Structures and Algorithms course that I took in my second year at the University of Pretoria. We had to create a working B+ Tree program in Java that could handle insertions and deletions from an unseen data set of arbitrary length. I completed and submitted the assignment in approximately three days, and was one of 13 students in a class of 329 to get 100% for the project. I implemented a blackbox fuzzer (see Main.java) which largely automated the testing process. Any error-causing test cases found by the fuzzer were then transferred over to manual-review (again, see Main.Java).
